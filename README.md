**Hi - I'm Misha** /br
**IT - System Engineer**
---
I am an autodidact, a programming enthusiast and a curious systems engineer. I tinker with servers, clouds and networks — and I'm learning to turn that curiosity into professional cybersecurity skills.

Just coding for fun and to get better every day.
🌱 In my free time I like to tortue myself by further deepening my knowledge in **CyberSec**, improving on **c#**, **SQL** and learning **game development** in **Godot** and **UE**.
