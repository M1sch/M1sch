## About me

Trying to level up from scrippt-kiddie to something not as embarassing

👨‍🎓 **System Engineer**

🌱 In my free time I like to tortue myself with writing scripts in **python**, **powershell** or **bash** |
Also improving on **c#**, **SQL** and learning **Godot**, **UE**, **game-/ music-/** and **character-design** and **game development** in general.
